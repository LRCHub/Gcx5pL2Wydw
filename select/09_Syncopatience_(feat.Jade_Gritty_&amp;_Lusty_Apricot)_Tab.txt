You and I
In syncopation
With a little patience
Motivation
A little inspiration

We can make our own escape
We can change our whole mindstate
We can fix our old mistakes
We can make the time to change

Start making our own rules
Stop thinking about old news
Stop holding on to
What's bound to
Just Bring you down

Turn it all around

Cause paradise can be inside
When feeling like the outside
And this is not the first time
That I've been away too long

For way too long

Cause paradise can be inside
When feeling like the outside
And this is not the first time
That I've been away too long

Still climbing
Still climbing
Still climbing
Still climbing

You and I
In syncopation
In a simulation
Simple basics
No reservations

We can make our own escape
We can change our whole mind state
We can fix our old mistakes
We can make the time to change

Start making our own rules
Stop thinking about old news
Stop holding on to
What's bound to
Just Bring you down

Turn it all around

Cause paradise can be inside
When feeling like the outside
And this is not the first time
That I've been away too long

For way too long

Cause paradise can be inside
When feeling like the outside
And this is not the first time
That I've been away too long

Still climbing
Still climbing
Still climbing
