I guess that's just how it works
Sometimes your moving
But your moving in reverse
Losing all your words with time

You can let your soul recline

Give in
Give in
Give in

I said that's not how this works
Sometimes your losing
But you're gaining what could work

This isn't just a waste of time

We can watch it all decline

Give in
Give in
Give in

Crawl out of the woodwork
Step out of your daydream
Stop living your old life
Stop doing the same

Start giving it all back
Start doing the right thing
Start looking at both sides

Stop peddling downstream
Downstream
Downstream
