I'm too far out
Can't see the shore
And i'm all out
You seem so sure of the fall out

We've pushed thru before
And I crawled out

Reach for more

And suddenly
We'll never be the same

The company
You want to keep has changed

It's puppetry
It's all a masquerade
Their vanity
Needs somebody to save

Run through the
Run through the storm

In the eye of the storm
I guess I had it wrong now
In the eye of the storm
It's a mystery gone now

In the eye of the storm
I guess I had it wrong now
In the eye of the storm
It's a mystery gone now

Just to run through the storm now
Just to run through the storm now

I'm too far gone
Can't see at all
And its past dawn
Feels so wrong yet i hold on
Push thru the fall and i'm withdrawn
Drift thru the fog

And suddenly
We'll never be the same

The company
You want to keep has changed

It's puppetry
It's all a masquerade
Their vanity
Needs somebody to save

Run through the
Run through the storm

In the eye of the storm
I guess I had it wrong now
In the eye of the storm
It's a mystery gone now

In the eye of the storm
I guess I had it wrong now
In the eye of the storm
It's a mystery gone now

Just to run through the storm now
Just to run through the storm now
